# Roulette

This project is on simulating a game of roulette at the casino.

A player starts by adding money to an account, then he can place bets.
Then a roulette will perform a modified random walk to land a ball on a number and the corresponding winnings (or losing) will be added to the account.
IF all the money is loss then it is game over.
